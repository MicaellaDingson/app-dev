## Comments: 
### *It's been a long time since I watched this kind of series since I'm into mistery, thriller, survival, and investigation side of any series or movies. I would say that it's not the usual romantic comedy. If you're going to dig every part of the scene and dialogue, you will be able to discover the relationship of Hae-Jo and Jo Jae-Mi with the world they are currently in.*
